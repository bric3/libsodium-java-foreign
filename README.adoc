= libsodium-ffi

_libsodium-ffi_ is a library that wrap calls to the Linux `libsodium.23.so` library
using the JDK 16 JEP 389 _Foreign Linker_ support in the incubating
module `jdk.incubator.foreign`.

This code has notably served as the base for the following blog post:

This could should work on macOS and Linux, and probably Windows too, however
the test only provides a location for a libsodium installed via Homebrew on macOS.
